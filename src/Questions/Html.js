      "How to create a Jenkins pipeline for deploying a React app built with Vite to AWS S3?",
    answer: `
         <p>
    This Jenkins pipeline automates the process of:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Cloning the repository.</li>
    <li>Installing dependencies.</li>
    <li>Building the React app using Vite.</li>
    <li>Deploying the build output to an AWS S3 bucket.</li>
</ol>

<p>The pipeline is structured with the following stages:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Clone Repository</strong>: Clones the 'Stagging' branch of the GitHub repository.</li>
    <li><strong>Install Dependencies</strong>: Runs 'npm install' to install project dependencies.</li>
    <li><strong>Build React Vite App</strong>: Executes 'npm run build' to generate the production build.</li>
    <li><strong>Deploy to S3</strong>: Uses AWS CLI to sync the contents of the 'dist' folder with the specified S3 bucket.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>post</code> block provides feedback based on whether the pipeline succeeds or fails.</p>

    answer: `
          <h3>Tailwind CSS</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Utility-first framework</strong> → You build designs using small helper classes.</li>
            <li><strong>More flexible</strong> → No pre-made styles, you create everything from scratch.</li>
            <li><strong>Lightweight</strong> → Only the styles you use are included.</li>
            <li><strong>Requires learning</strong> → You need to understand utility classes.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Example:</h4>
          <pre><code>
          &lt;button class="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-md hover:bg-blue-700"&gt;
            Click Me
          &lt;/button&gt;
          </code></pre>
      
          <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Component-based framework</strong> → Comes with pre-styled buttons, forms, modals, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Less flexible</strong> → You have to override styles to customize.</li>
            <li><strong>Quick to use</strong> → Great for fast development without designing from scratch.</li>
            <li><strong>Larger file size</strong> → Includes styles you might not use.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <h4>Example:</h4>
          <pre><code>
          &lt;button class="btn btn-primary"&gt;
            Click Me
          &lt;/button&gt;
          </code></pre>
      
          <h3>Which One to Use in a React App?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Choose Tailwind CSS</strong> if you want a custom design and better performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Choose Bootstrap</strong> if you need a ready-made UI with less effort.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <h3>Best for React?</h3>
          <p><strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> is better for React because:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>✅ Works well with components.</li>
            <li>✅ Helps keep styles inside JSX.</li>
            <li>✅ Smaller file size → Faster performance.</li>
